                    <h3>Hell's Hollow</h3>
                    <p>Hell's Hollow is the most popular waterfall in McConnells Mill to visit. The trail to get to the falls is a relatively short and easy hike. The trail itself consists of interesting scenery such as a stream that runs alongside the trail and a nice variety of plant life. The waterfall is quite small in comparison to other waterfalls in the park; however, the falls flow heavier than the rest, making for excellent scenery.</p>

                    <h3>Kildoo Falls</h3>
                    <p> Kildoo Falls is by far the most unique waterfall to grace McConnells Mill. The waterfall flows over an overhang allowing hikers to venture under the falls. Interestingly, under the falls there are multiple handprints on the cave wall, it is unknown as to how long or why these prints are here.
                        There are many routes to Kildoo Falls, for a shorter hike park at the Mill and for a longer hike park near the Alpha Falls trailhead or the parking lot directly after.</p><br>

                    <h3>McConnells Mill</h3>
                    <p>Reaching the mill is fairly easy, you can either park at the mill or park at any nearby parking lot. The hike should take no longer than 15-45 minutes to reach the mill depending on where you park such as the Alpha Falls, Picnic Area, or the lot in between Alpha Falls and the Picnic Area.<br>
                        The mill is the most highly trafficed portion of the park, so expect to see plenty of other hikers on the trails nearby.<br>
                        The park offers tours of the historic mill at 1 and 2PM, however, the historic gristmill at McConnells Mill State Park is open Memorial Day through late September on Wednesdays through Sundays from 10:30 AM to 3:30 PM.</p><br>

                    <h3>Alpha Falls</h3>
                    <p>Alpha Falls is the largest waterfall in the park, making it also one of the most visited sections of the park so be prepared for other hikers. The trail to the falls is relatively short, as you enter the Alpha Pass trail you will see a sign on the right that directs you towards the falls. The falls are no more than a 5 minute walk from that point. Alpha Falls are incredibly impressive, without a doubt they're worth a visit! It is difficult to express how these falls make you feel, but I felt as if I was in a different world. Even the atmosphere surrounding the falls is surreal, pictures do not do this attraction justice.<br> If you continue down the Alpha Pass it will bring you to the mill. Alpha pass is also an amazing trail packed with impressive boulders and a cave(of sorts).</p>

                    <h3>Rock Climbing: The Kildoo Boulder</h3>
                    <p>Overall this is a very fun and easy climb. However, before bouldering be sure to have the proper safety equiptment such as pads. As far as I know, this boulder has not been used in the past so it has no name or grade, it is most likely a V0-V1.
                      <br>  To reach the boulder begin to take the trail up to Kildoo Falls, before the trail steeply ascends you will see a few trails that branch off to the right. Take the highest trail for about 10-15 minutes and you will find the boulder.</p>

                    <h3>GrindStone Falls</h3>
                    <p>Out of all the trails in McConnells Mill, Grindstone Falls is the most difficult to traverse. The trail is covered in mud and has a few steep declines you have to go down to get to the falls. Fortunately, the trail is easy to follow and short. <br>The falls itself are small but flow well, especially after rain. However, the better the falls flow, the more muddy the trail will be due to the rain. Making your way back up from the falls is the most difficult part of the hike. The walk back is mostly uphill and very steep, paired with mud it is somewhat difficult to walk back up. I highly recommend wearing boots and pants for this trail. Also, the trail has a lot of long grass you will likely be touching so be wary of tics.<br> In conclusion, the trail is decent but the falls are by far the best part of the hike.
